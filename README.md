Reversi
=======

Command line Java application that let's you play the game of Reversi (also known as Othello) against computer.

## Current known bugs (6.4.2018)

* My interpretation of the game rules might differ from the official rules. If either player can not play, the game ends.

## TODO (at least)

* UI
* More unit tests
* Better heuristic for analyzing the current board situation
