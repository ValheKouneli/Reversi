Reversi
=======

Command line Java application that let's you play the game of Reversi (also known as Othello) against computer.

## Current known bugs (27.3.2018)

* At least AI can somehow play on top of another piece at least in some situations?!?!

## TODO

* Make lots and lots of unit tests especially for ReversiHelper
* Make ReversiHelper methods all use one general reverse method
* Make ReversiHelper functions have an option to turn or to nor turn pieces at the same time (so when checking move legality, we don't have to copy board)
