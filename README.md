Reversi
=======

Command line Java application, Reversi AI.

## Current known bugs (11.4.2018)

* My interpretation of the game rules might differ from the official rules. If either player can not play, the game ends.

## TODO (at least)

* Remove the hidious <MoveType> <GameType> thingies from the AIs :O~
* Fix the implementation of rules (see current known bugs)
* Make command line user interface
* Make more unit tests
