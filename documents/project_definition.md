Project Definition
==================

The aim of the project is to create an AI for the game Reversi (also known as Othello). The AI uses min max algorithm with adjustable tree depth.
Different heuristics to evaluate the current board situation can be compared against each other. A Monte-Carlo algorithm can be used in stead of or with a heuristic.
