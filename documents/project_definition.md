Project Definition
==================

The aim of the project is, first, to create a simple AI for the game Reversi (also known as Othello). The AI should use the min max algorithm with adjustable tree depth.

After that, the goal is to find information about different, previously invented heuristics for evaluating the on-going board situation and compare them.

The next step is to impove the AI in one way or another, keeping it's thinking time limited to one second per turn. A Monte-Carlo algorithm can be used in stead of or with a heuristic.

Monte Carlo bot and Minimax Bot are compared against each other.
