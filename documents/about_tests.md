About tests
===========

Unit test are made with JUnit. They don't cover package reversi.AI.minimax.timelimited, because it is reduntant.
Run tests with gradle test and (assuming the build is succesful) check the coverage report in /build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html.

Running Main.java tests the performance of the MinimaxAI Reversi bot and MCTS Reversi Bot against each other.
