Progress Report: Week 6
=======================

Monday: Made a working version of the command line user interface.

Time spent: 3h

Tuesday: Made improvements(?) to user interface classes. Made a time limited Minimax bot (breadth first branching out).

Time spent: 5h

Tuesday: Made Reversi use the official rules for the game, i.e. the game end only when both players can not play.
Made some tests for older classes to make sure they are not the cause for the human player input bug. They weren't. Started to change the user interface â€“ I want to be able to pause the game between to AI's by pressing space. Looked into multi-threading :SS

Time spent: 3h
