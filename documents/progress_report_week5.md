Tuesday: tried to learn how to draw UML class diagrams. Drew some.

Time spent: 1h

Wednesday: made some unit tests and refactored the code the make testing easier and code neater.

Time spent: 2h

Thursday: More unit tests. Found a bug. Started making tests to fix it too.

Time spent: 1h

Thursday: More unit tests. Rewrote MCTS because the old version (which was made according to a tutorial!) was erronous! Found the bug, finally, and fixed it. In the process, managed to do some regretful changes to the MCTS data structures.

Time spent: 4h

Thursday: More unit tests. I found out some more mistakes my MCTSbot had because I followed that bad tutorial at first. I corrected my mistakes and now the bot is so much stronger.

Time spent: 3h

Friday: Started implementing a command line user interface. I tried to use the Model–view–controller pattern. I'd like it to be easy to made a GUI later on.

Time spent: 3h
